END finalize a Transaction. Transactions created using BEGIN...COMMIT do not nest.For nested transactions, use the SAVEPOINT and RELEASE commands \n - **create_index**: Create indexes in tables. Indexes allow the database application to find data fast; without reading the whole table \n - **create_table**: Create a table in a database. Tables are organized into rows and columns; and each table must have a name. \n - **create_trigger**: Triggers are database operations that are automatically performed when a specified database event occurs. \n - **create_view**: Create a view in a database. A view Enable filtering and aggregating data coming from one or more table. \n - **detach**: Release a Database previously bound with attach\n - **drop_index**: Remove an index added with the CREATE INDEX statement.\n - **drop_table**: Remove a table added with the CREATE TABLE statement.\n - **drop_trigger**: Remove a trigger created by the CREATE TRIGGER statement.\n - **drop_view**:Remove a view created by the CREATE VIEW statement.\n - **pragma**: Used to modify the operation of the SQLite library or to query the SQLite library for internal (non-table) data.\n - **reindex**: Used to delete and recreate indices from scratch.\n - **release**: Like a COMMIT for a SAVEPOINT.\n - **rollback**: Revert the state of the database back to what it was just after the corresponding SAVEPOINT.\n - **savepoint**: A method of creating transactions, similar to BEGIN and COMMIT, except that the SAVEPOINT and RELEASE commands are named and may be nested.\n - **vaccum**: Rebuild the database file, repacking it into a minimal amount of disk space.
