# History

I have started with [tabakins](https://github.com/tabatkins/railroad-diagrams) railroad-diagrams fork, but a lot evolutions took place then, not only one can display the svg but
- generate the validator
- validate (is the sentence well formed or not)
- get the "compiled" result: which part of the sentence is what?
